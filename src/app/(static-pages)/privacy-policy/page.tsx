        <h2>Revocation of Your Consent to Data Processing</h2>
        <p className='text-neutral-600 dark:text-neutral-300'>
          Some data processing operations are only possible with your explicit
          consent. You may revoke your consent at any time. An informal email

        <h2>Right to Data Portability</h2>
        <p className='text-neutral-600 dark:text-neutral-300'>
          You have the right to have data that we process based on your consent
          or in fulfillment of a contract automatically handed over to you or to
          a third party. The data will be provided in a machine-readable format.
          If you request the direct transfer of the data to another responsible
          party, this will only be done to the extent that it is technically
          feasible.
        </p>

        <h2>Right to Information, Correction, Blocking, Deletion</h2>
        <p className='text-neutral-600 dark:text-neutral-300'>
          Within the framework of the applicable legal provisions, you have the
          right at any time to free information about your stored personal data,
          their origin, and recipient, as well as the purpose of the data
          processing and, if applicable, a right to correction, blocking, or

        <h2>SSL or TLS Encryption</h2>
        <p className='text-neutral-600 dark:text-neutral-300'>
          For security reasons and to protect the transmission of confidential
          content that you send to us as the site operator, our website uses SSL
          or TLS encryption. This means that data you transmit via this website
          cannot be read by third parties. You can recognize an encrypted
          connection by the "https://" address line of your browser and the lock
          icon in the browser line.

          </ul>
          <p>
            There is no merging of this data with other data sources. The basis
            for data processing is Art. 6(1)(b) DSGVO, which permits the
            processing of data to fulfill a contract or pre-contractual
            measures.

            details, will be stored to process your request or to be available
            for follow-up questions. This data will not be passed on without
            your consent.
          </p>
          <p>
            The processing of the data entered in the contact form takes place
            exclusively based on your consent (Art. 6(1)(a) DSGVO). You may
            revoke your consent at any time. An informal email notification is
            sufficient for the revocation. The legality of the data processing
            carried out until the revocation remains unaffected by the
            revocation.
          </p>
          <p>
            Data transmitted via the contact form will remain with us until you
            request us to delete it, revoke your consent to storage, or the
            purpose for data storage no longer applies. Mandatory legal
            provisions - especially retention periods - remain unaffected.

        <h2>Newsletter Data</h2>
        <div className='text-neutral-600 dark:text-neutral-300'>
          <p>
            To send our newsletter, we need an email address from you.
            Verification of the specified email address is necessary, and
            consent to receive the newsletter is required. Additional data is

            solely based on your consent (Art. 6(1)(a) DSGVO). You may revoke
            your consent at any time. An informal email notification is
            sufficient for the revocation or you can use the "unsubscribe" link
            in the newsletter. The legality of the data processing operations
            already carried out remains unaffected by the revocation.
          </p>
          <p>
            Data entered to set up the subscription will be deleted if you
            cancel your subscription. If this data has been transmitted to us

        <div className='text-neutral-600 dark:text-neutral-300'>
          <p>
            Our website uses plugins from YouTube for the integration and
            display of video content. The provider of the video portal is
            YouTube, LLC, 901 Cherry Ave., San Bruno, CA 94066, USA.
          </p>
          <p>
            When you visit a page with an integrated YouTube plugin, a

            YouTube can directly assign your surfing behavior to your personal

            this by logging out of your YouTube account beforehand.

          <p>
            The use of YouTube is in the interest of an attractive presentation
            of our online offers. This constitutes a legitimate interest within
